# RSA-Encryption
This repo contain a very basic implementation of RSA-algorithm in java.
It takes 2 prime number as inputs and a message assumed to be a number, generates a public-private key pair outputs encrypted message and decipher the encrypted message using private keys.

This also contains compiled class file BasicRSA.class
To run this in a local repo, open terminal 

```bash
    java BasicRSA
```
 
 if you make changes to BasicRSA.java and want to compile use:

 ```bash
    javac BasicRSA.java
 ```
 Or you can run directly without compiling:

 ```Bash
    java BasicRSA.java
 ```
